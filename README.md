##### MiniProject2
Attempted as part of RISE by DigitalBCGAcademy program, Business and Data Analytics track in 2021. 

The statistical analysis project required us to answer business questions and perform hypothesis testing in Jupyter Notebook based on a real industry challenge (mobile puzzle game). 

A starter code was provided for this project.

Python codes tested for this project were:
– Filtering data frames based on column(s) 
– Splitting data into multiple data frame(s) 
– Shape of data frame, counting rows and length 
– Adding/deleting column(s) to a data frame 
– Aggregations and merging data frames 
– Grouping, pivot table, cross tabs 
– Scatter plots, histogram, box plots, etc.

Statistical analysis topics for this project were: 
hypothesis testing, tests for normality and homogeneity of variances, non parametric test
